## Doing is Better Than Reading or Watching

I got my first laptop when I started web development back in 2022. It had been a long time coming, as I had only known the struggles of learning on an old Intel Go HP desktop, which was painfully slow and had poor networking capabilities. Iâ€™m incredibly grateful to my dad for getting me the laptop, which enabled me to dive into web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Starting from scratch was pretty amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, guided by one of the best web development teachers, [Dave Gray](https://courses.davegray.codes). The dev community was also incredibly supportive.

The core message I want to share is that doing is better than reading or watching. After my initial learning phase, I built numerous projects based on the knowledge I gained from Dave Gray. His coaching was invaluable, and it took me a bit longer to master programming and markup languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I built several projects, but I often found myself stuck in the planning phase. I would imagine what to build, visualize its appearance and functionality, but never take the next step to start the actual work. This cycle of overthinking and inaction led to many unfinished projects. Eventually, I sought recommendations and guidance from experts who helped me focus on doing rather than just reading or watching.

By July 2022, I began working on JavaScript projects, which significantly improved my skills as a developer. I learned that progress, not perfection, should be our goal. Understanding the fundamentals pays off in any field, whether technical or non-technical.

I'm excited to share the projects I built during that time. Itâ€™s important to remember that hands-on experience is invaluable. Doing is indeed better than reading or watching.

Thanks for reading, and I wish you a great day! <b>Cheers ðŸ¥‚</b>
